# How to get AWS Certified 

Is getting certified good ? Does certificate carry any value?

These are subjective questions therefore the answer may vary or will vary. But one thing every one would agree is that the certificate may not carry any value( depends) but the knowlege gained in the process is definitely valuable. Again quesiton comes why do we need to get certified in order to gain knowledge? We do not , but when there is not goal, we will not do a through reading or practice. Having a goal compels us to do things which we may not do otherwise. 

Also, it will definitely gives us confidence while working on cloud or finding new jobs inside or outside on the organisation.  Thus, personally, I will see a great value of getting certified. 

How can I get certified? 

# Pre-certification
Before we delve into certification details, lets discuss a few terminologies:

### What is AWS and /or Cloud computing?
cloud computing is delivery of IT and related services through the means of internet.  AWS is cloud offering from Amazon.


#### what is  Pay as you go pricing model ?
#### what is on -demand computing ?
#### what is well archited framework ?
#### what is an elastic computing?
#### what is scalling and how does it differ from elasticity?


## Types of cloud or cloud deployment model
There are three types of cloud deployments:

#### 1. Private cloud 
#### 2. Public cloud 
#### 3. Hybridge 


## Cloud services 
#### There are 3 types of cloud computing services

#### Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS )
#### Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS)
#### Software-as-a-Service(SaaS )

#### Also we may even say Storage, Database, Information, Process, Application, Integration, Security, Management, and Testing-as-a-service

# Global Infrastructure:
AWS Global Infrastructure consists of:
1) **Regions:**
A region is a geographically seperated location in the world. Regions are designed to be completely isolated from one another.
A region consists of one or more Avalability Zones(AZ's)
2) **Availability Zones(AZ):**
An AZ Consists of one or more discrete data centers. Each have redundant power supply. They are chosen to be away from areas that get flooded.
### Global Infrastructure Benefits:
Availability and Fault Tolerance
Fulfill data residency and compliance requirements
Ability to go global in minutes.

The AWS Cloud spans 55 Availability Zones within 18 geographic Regions and 1 Local Region around the world, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more Regions in Bahrain, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the US.
