## Global Infrastructure:
AWS Global Infrastructure consists of:

### Regions:
A region is a geographically seperated location in the world. Regions are designed to be completely isolated from one another. A region consists of two or more Avalability Zones(AZ's)
### Availability Zones(AZ):
An AZ Consists of one or more discrete data centers. Each have redundant power supply. They are chosen to be away from areas that get flooded.
Global Infrastructure Benefits:
