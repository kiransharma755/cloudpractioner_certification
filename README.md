### How to get AWS Certified 

Is getting certified good ? Does certificate carry any value?

These are subjective questions. So the answer may vary. But one thing every one would agree is that the certificate may not carry any value but the knowlege gained in the process is definitely valuable. Again quesiton comes why do we need to get certified in order to gain knowledge? It does not, but when there is not goal, we will not do a through reading or practice. Having a gola compels us to do things which we may not do otherwise. 

## Pre-certification

## Security : The Shared Security Model

### Trusted Advisor 
1. Cost Optimization—recommendations that can reduce expenses by highlighting idle resources or by committing reserved resources.

Example: Idle Load Balancers flags load balancers which are either not connected to any back-end instances or handling extremely low traffic.

2. Security—recommendations that can harden your AWS services against intruders by enabling various security features.

Example: MFA on Root Account checks if multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been enabled on a root account. AWS strongly recommends enabling MFA on root accounts to enhance security.

3. Fault Tolerance—suggestions that enhance the resilience of your applications by highlighting health issues, missing backups, and redundancy shortfalls.

Example: Amazon RDS Multi-AZ checks if the DB instance has been deployed in a single availability zone. In such a scenario, a DB failure will cause an outage because of a lack of high availability. Alternatively, a high-availability setup resumes operating from the standby database without any disruption to the business.

4. Performance—suggestions that can increase the overall performance of your applications and cloud infrastructure by checking your service limits and monitoring instances.

Example: High Utilization Amazon EC2 Instances checks the CPU utilization during the previous two weeks and sends alerts if daily utilization exceeded 90% for more than three days. Consistently high utilization can lead to application performance issues.

There are six core Trusted Advisor checks, which are provided to customers free of charge. The remaining premium checks can be implemented by upgrading to business or enterprise support plans. The six core checks fall under the following security and performance categories:

PerformanceService Limits
SecuritySecurity Groups – Specific Ports Unrestricted
IAM Use
MFA on Root Access
EBS Public Snapshots
RDS Public Snapshots
